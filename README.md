## Installation

Download the Bash script inside this repo to your machine and save it in your Bangazon directory (recommended).

Open the script in a text editor and update the `PATH/TO/DATABASE.DB` line. Save the changes.

Open your `~/.zshrc` file and create an alias that links to the Bash script like so:

`alias bangazon="bash PATH/TO/bangazonDevCLI.sh"`

Restart your terminal and run `bangazon` to show available commands.
